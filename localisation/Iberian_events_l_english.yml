 leonese_events.3.t:0 "The Iberian Wedding"
 leonese_events.3.d:0 "$MOANRCH$, $MONARCHTITLE$ of Leon, was married to the princess of Castile in Valladolid in October 1469. This was a marriage of political opportunism, not romance. The court of Leon dreamed of a return to Castile, and Castille's princess needed help to gain succession to the throne. The marriage initiated a dark and troubled life, in which $MONARCH$ fought on the Castilian and Leonese fronts in order to impose his authority over the noble oligarchies, shifting his basis of support from one kingdom to the other according to the intensity of the danger. Many considered $MONARCH$ the savior of his kingdoms, a bringer of unity. Others despised him for having oppressed them. Machiavelli attributed to him the objectionable qualities of the Renaissance prince."
