#Anjou
 cl_infoevents.2.d.anjou:0 "The kingdom of Anjou starts off with the glorious Richard of Anjou, a king dying of old age. Upon the death of Richard, an event with fire which will let the player choose what path their nation should take, which will change their mission tree accordingly.\n\nAnjou will be able to choose between the following paths:\n\n\n§RAngevin Path§! This path focuses on the restoration of the lost Angevin Empire. The France region becomes an afterthought for Anjou, as they focus on reconquering the British Isles.\n\n§BFrench Path§! This mission tree is fairly similar to that of Capet, focusing on a militaristic conquest of the France region. It's essentially an easier start compared to Capet, with the same end goal.\n\n§PDiplomatic Path§! Continue the legacy of Richard of Anjou with the diplomatic path. These missions focus on spreading the Anjou dynasty far and wide, conquering France through personal unions. Their missions unlock a unique government reform which gives them tax modifiers based upon their royal marriages and personal unions. They are a great nation for those who enjoy a more laid back, tall playstyle."
