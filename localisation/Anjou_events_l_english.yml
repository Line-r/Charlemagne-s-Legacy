ANJ_events.1.t:0 "The Anjou Succession"
 ANJ_events.1.d:0 "Good king Richard of Anjou has returned to his Creator. His legacy is one of unparalleled stability and diplomacy, yet the future for the Angevin realm remains uncertain. Despite all the prosperity the kingdom has reveled in under his rule, it had also remained stagnant. The house of Anjou still has its uncontested claims over the lands of Britain and France. Now the question remains, what path shall [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] take?"

 ANJ_events.4.t:0 "The Sisterhood of Orleans"
 ANJ_events.4.d:0 "A local order of Catholic Nuns dedicated to Saint Joan of Arc have come to us with the most peculiar news. They assert that since it took a pious maid to save [Root.GetName] when Britain was lost, then who could be more efficient at fighting [Root.GetName]'s enemies then a militant order of nuns? They call themselves the 'Order of Our Martyred Lady' and stand ready to fight for us."
 ANJ_events.4.a:0 "A militant order of nuns? How ridiculous! Tell them to get back to praying."

 ANJ_events.8.t:0 "Anjou, Ascendant"
 ANJ_events.8.d:0 "Our grand realm has been entrusted with the leadership of the empire. Lothair's crown now resides in the hands of [Root.Monarch.GetName].
