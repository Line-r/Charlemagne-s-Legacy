 swa_events.1.d:0 "The old Duchy of Swabia ended with the execution of Conradin, the last of the Hohenstaufen Dukes, in 1268. Since then, a plethora of countries, bishoprics and cities have emerged to fill the void left by the fall of the Hohenstaufens. Now, with the reconsolidation of these lands, the Swabian Confederacy blesses the world with its presence. Consul [Root.Monarch.GetName] being the first leader of this grand republic, shall spread prosperity and ever-lasting peace through the confederation."

His ideology is juxtaposed to our republic's ideals, calling for war against our neighbours, a world 'ruled by Swabia'. Now it has come to our attention that his ideas have been catching on with our people. We can only hope that he dies in a ditch some time soon."
